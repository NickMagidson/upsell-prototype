-- Note: This migration previously attempted to modify storage.buckets and storage.objects
-- which require superuser permissions and should be configured via Supabase Dashboard.
--
-- Storage configuration should be done manually:
-- 1. Go to Storage → Buckets in Supabase Dashboard
-- 2. Ensure 'chat_attachments' bucket exists with:
--    - Public: true
--    - File size limit: 50MB
--    - Allowed MIME types: image/*, application/pdf
-- 3. Configure storage policies as needed via Dashboard → Storage → Policies
--
-- This migration is now a no-op to avoid permission errors.

-- Placeholder comment to ensure migration runs successfully
